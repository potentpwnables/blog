# Me

I'm an autodidact with a lot of interests that encompass a wide range of topics including, but definitely not limited to, mathematics, statistics, programming, computer science, reverse engineering, threat hunting, encryption, CTFs, machine learning, and AI. I don't really see a need to focus on any of those in particular and instead of just move around them as I see fit. 

# The Blog

This blog is an attempt at sharing my learnings and musings with others. I'm not a great writer, and not very good at sticking to a schedule, so don't get your hopes up about consistent, quality content. But with any luck, you'll at least find it interesting. 

The site itself is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), via Github and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The theme is based on [Beautiful Hugo](https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo) with some custom modifications made by me. Tibbles 'N Bits is a bit of a play on words, spoofing on the dog food Kibbles 'N Bits. [Tibbles] (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html) are modified data frames, and the terminology was introduced with the advent of the "tidyverse" in R, my primary language for conducting and communicating quantitative analyses. Bits are, of course, ones and zeroes. The whole name is meant to give the impression that the posts will dabble in a little bit of everything, but will have a heavy focus on programming and cyber security.
